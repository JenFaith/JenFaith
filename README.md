# Hi there

I'm Jennifer. I build scalable, thoughtfully engineered systems for working with data and knowledge. My background blends engineering and behavioral science, which lets me approach technical problems with an emphasis on usability, clarity, and human-centered design. I’m especially interested in system architecture, automation, and tools that make complex workflows more efficient and transparent.

## Ask me about some of my recent projects!

### PoliDraft
A research tool that transforms dense policy and scientific materials into structured, accessible insights using automated retrieval and synthesis workflows.

### Biosensor Integration Platform
A system designed to unify data from multiple biosensor sources into a single, coherent layer that supports analysis, monitoring, and research applications.
