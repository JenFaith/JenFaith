# Hi there

I'm Jennifer. I build scalable, thoughtfully engineered systems priarily to make working with data accessible and easy. My background blends engineering and behavioral science, which lets me approach technical problems with an emphasis on usability, clarity, and human-centered design. I’m especially interested in system architecture, automation, and tools that make complex workflows more efficient and transparent.

## Ask me about some of my recent projects!

### PoliDraft
A system that applies RAG retrieval, document parsing, and automated synthesis to convert complex policy and scientific materials into structured, searchable outputs for researchers.

### Biosensor Integration Platform
A system designed to unify data from multiple biosensor sources into a single, coherent layer that supports analysis, monitoring, and research applications.
