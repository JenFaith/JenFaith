### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jennifer, a software develope and data specialist passionate about solving problems related to science and biotech. Right now, I'm currently working on an application that allows users to search for nursing homes in the United States and receive a report back about covid cases, health violations, and health outcomes. Beyond that, I'm learning a lot about processing images and creating convolutional neural networks.
